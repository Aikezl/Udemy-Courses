### Analysis
________
From the above findings, it can be deduced that:
Web Development is the most subscribed course followed by Business Finance, then Graphic Design and then Musical Instruments being the least of all. According to figure 6, the level most subscribed to is ALL LEVEL.

Then the highest revenue generating levels per subject according to TABLE 3 are:Web development (All levels), Business Finance (Beginner Level), Graphic Design (Intermediate level) and then Web development (Expert Level).

But according to Figure 4, Web development being the most revenue generating course has most of the subscription taken free. Infact, 80% of the subscribers of each of the courses chose the “free plan”
From the analysis, the following can be agreed on:
The most subscribed course is Web development with over 6million subscribers, although 80% of the subscribers chose the "FREE" Plan

Musical Instruments course is the least revenue generating course

Subscribers prefer ALL LEVELS package and BEGINNERS LEVEL package over other subject levels package with both getting over 5million paid subscribers and over 3milion free subscribers.
__________
### Recommendation
________
As a result of the analysis and also in order to generate more revenue, the following recommendations are made:
Web development course should be more appraised and well marketed, possibly by offering a discount in the price of each level as it's the most subscribed course. And it tends to perform well for the coming years

Business finance and Graphic design might be the next big thing in the next few years, so more marketing strategy should be employed towards the courses. Possibly by extracting the All levels package from the courses, then make Beginner's level free and attach a cost to the other two progressive levels.

Musical instruments course is not hitting the market as expected, so it can be replaced by a new course like content creation, forex trading or online affiliate marketing. Musical instruments course can also be used as a bonus course for the paid levels on Business finance and Graphic design.

Since subscribers tends to prefer the All levels package, in order to appraise other levels, The package for the courses should be a two-way thing, where All level will stand as a separate package with an increased cost and Beginners-Expert levels will stand as another package but with a lower total cost compared to All levels package, let's say 5% reduction.
_________
### Conclusion
________
The highest revenue generating course is Web development course with over 7million subscribers.

Subscribers prefer All level package to other package with All level package getting over 6million subscribers.

Free subscribers are way more than paid subscribers with Free package getting over 27,000 subscribers averagely.

Web development course should be more appraised and well marketed to generate more revenue.

Musical instrument course should be replaced with a new course.

Business finance and Graphic Design course should be well marketed too as they might be the big thing in the next few years.
